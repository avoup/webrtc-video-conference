# WebRTC Video Conference

**Live demo:** https://webrtc-video-conference-sample.herokuapp.com/

WebRTC video conference sample application. Uses Mesh architecture (every participant sends and receives its media to all other participants).

## Getting Started

In your terminal type:

```bash
# Clone from Github
git clone https://github.com/avoup/webrtc-video-conference myproject

# Change directory
cd myproject

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

# Start app
npm start

```

## Adding ssl to the server

```bash
#Create key and certificate:
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem

# Create sslcert folder and move the files there:
mkdir sslcert && mv *.pem sslcert
```

# Documentation

Project uses Webrtc API without external libraries, for signaling it uses socket.io, stun and turn servers are publicly available free servers, see the list [here](https://gist.github.com/sagivo/3a4b2f2c7ac6e1b5267c2f1f59ac6c6b).

For easy implementation and modular design all the webrtc logic is contained in the Webrtc class in `public/js/webrtc.js` file. This class is an extension of EventTarget class, meaning it emits events and we can add event listeners to it.
The class's construction function takes 3 arguments
<br>
<br>
**_Note:_** _private properties and methods of the class are named starting with underscore('\_privateProp') and should not be accessed from outside.
<br>
JS's built in private properties ('#privateProp') are not used as that's a relatively new future and only newest versions of the browsers support it._

```js
class Webrtc extends EventTarget {
    constructor(socket, pcConfig, logging) {
        super();
        ...
    }
```

example initialization

```js
const webrtc = new Webrtc(
    socket,
    { iceServers: [{ urls: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' }] },
    {
        log: true,
        warn: true,
        error: true,
    }
);
```

## Arguments

-   **socket** - socket.io instance (_required at least version 4.1.3_)
-   **pcConfig** - peer connection configuration. Stun/Turn servers can be passed here. If not provided webrtc will not use any servers and will be operational only on local network. Any number of stun and turn servers can be passed.

```js
{
    iceServers: [
        {
            urls: [
                'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302',
                'stun:stun1.l.google.com:19302'
            ],
        },
        {
            urls: 'turn:numb.viagenie.ca',
            credential: 'muazkh',
            username: 'webrtc@live.com',
        },
    ],
}
```

-   **logging** - enable or disable logging on actions.
    -   log - enable console.log
    -   warn - enable console.warn
    -   error - enable console.error

```js
{
    log: true,
    warn: true,
    error: true,
}
```

## webrtc.getLocalStream()

After initialization local media stream should be accessed.

```js
webrtc
    .getLocalStream(true, { width: 640, height: 480 })
    .then((stream) => (localVideo.srcObject = stream));
```

getLocalStream takes two arguments for `audio` and `video` constraints. It returns promise, which returns a stream from local media that can be attached to an HTML audio or video element as a source, element should be set on `autoplay`.

The method actually returns [navigator.getUserMedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia).

## webrtc.joinRoom()

After initialization room can be joined with `joinRoom` method.

```js
webrtc.joinRoom('room-1');
```

events `createdRoom` and `joinedRoom` will be emitted if join or creation of room was successful. After that `webrtc.gotStream()` can be called to notify server that local stream is ready for sharing.

## webrtc.leaveRoom()

Closes all open connections and leaves the current room. On successful leave event `leftRoom` will be emitted with room ID.

## webrtc.kickUser()

kick user with the given socket id from the call.

```js
webrtc.kickUser(socketId);
```

## Events

As mentioned `Webrtc` instance emits events, which can be listened to with [EventTarget.addEventListener()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener). Some of the events return data in `event.detail` property.

# Stun and Turn servers

The project uses free stun and turn servers. For production use you might need to consider other alternatives.
<br>
If you want to build your own turn server consider using [coturn server](https://github.com/coturn/coturn).

If you are willing to pay to get these services there are providers who offer them:

-   [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/stun-turn)
-   [Xirsys](https://xirsys.com/)
-   [Kurento](https://www.kurento.org/)
